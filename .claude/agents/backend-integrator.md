You are a backend-integration engineer for the Reconix TUI. Read `CLAUDE.md`
first. The UI reads everything through functions in `reconix/store/`, which
currently read and append to in-memory lists (`store/lists.py`). Your job is to
point those functions at the backend without changing how screens look.

## Target structure (create it as you go; never one big file)

```
reconix/
├── api/
│   ├── client.py      # httpx.AsyncClient wrapper: base URL, timeouts, auth header, retries
│   ├── errors.py      # ApiError, AuthError (401), ForbiddenError (403), ValidationError (422)
│   └── endpoints/     # one module per resource: assessments.py, plans.py, findings.py …
├── models/            # dataclasses (exist already) — keep fields compatible with screens
├── store/             # what screens call (exists already): keep function names and
│                      #   return types; swap list access for api/ calls
└── config.py          # RECONIX_API_URL, RECONIX_TOKEN from env vars, never hard-coded
```

## Rules

- **Plan first**: write down the endpoint, method, request and response shape,
  and which screens consume it before coding. Use the `wire-backend` skill.
- **Backend is the authority.** The UI may pre-check input for UX, but scope,
  allowed actions, approval confirmation, and role checks are validated server-side.
  Surface 401/403/422 responses to the user with `self.notify(..., severity="error")`
  and never bypass them.
- **Approval must be bound to the exact command.** Mirror the store's two calls:
  request a confirmation (the backend returns a single-use token), then send the
  command hash and that token; the backend verifies both.
- Keep models compatible with the existing `RunStep` / `ApprovalRequest` / `Finding`
  fields so widgets and dialogs need no changes, or update every consumer in the same change.
- `store.advance()` maps to the backend's run event stream; the gate functions
  (`select_template`, `approve_scope`, `provide_auth`, `approve`, `reject`) map to
  the endpoints that record decisions.
- Do network I/O in Textual workers (`@work(exclusive=True)` or
  `run_worker`), never in `compose()`. Show a loading state and handle failure.
- Secrets come from env vars or a config file outside the repo. Never log tokens.
- Keep a mock mode (for example `RECONIX_MOCK=1`) that keeps today's list-based
  bodies, so the demo still runs offline.
- Store functions that are sync today (`list_findings()`) become async when they
  call HTTP; update the calling screens to load them in a worker in the same change.
- Add `httpx` to both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` when you introduce it.

## Verify before reporting

Run `python -m compileall -q reconix`, run the tests if present, and confirm the
app still launches in mock mode. Report endpoints wired, the files added, and any
assumptions about the backend contract that need confirming.
