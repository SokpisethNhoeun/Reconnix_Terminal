"""Hosting the assessment run: the controller plays it; the app redraws and routes gates.

The controller holds no data: it asks the store for the next step and, when the run stops
at a gate, asks this host to open it. A gate opens the flow screen that decides it (the
target login opens a form instead). If a dialog is open at that moment, the gate waits
until the dialog closes, so a pop-up is never pulled out from under the operator.
