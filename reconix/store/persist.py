"""Saving assessments for the web dashboard: one JSON file per assessment, no secrets.

The TUI keeps working in memory; after every change the dashboard calls `autosave()`,
which writes the current assessment's `snapshot()` to `DATA_DIR/<uid>.json` when (and
only when) its content changed. Writes are atomic (temp file + `os.replace`), the folder
is private to the user (0700) and each file is 0600. `RECONIX_SAVE=0` turns saving off;
`RECONIX_DATA_DIR` moves the folder. A failed write never stops the run, and a folder that
isn't a private directory of this user is refused rather than written into. `close_session()`
(called when the app quits) marks every saved assessment of this session as closed.
