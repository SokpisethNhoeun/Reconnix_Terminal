"""Short answers for prompt lines that are not a target — rule-based, no LLM.

Before a run, a line that names no target does not start one: Reconix answers in one or
two sentences and says what to type. A keyword without a target ("scan my network") gets
what that template needs. During a run, a greeting or thanks gets a friendly line and
anything else the usual pointer to the keys. With the LLM backend these become the agent's
chat replies; the store function names stay.
