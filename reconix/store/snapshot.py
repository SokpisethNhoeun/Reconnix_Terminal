"""A plain-data copy of one assessment, for the read-only web dashboard.

`snapshot()` turns an `Assessment` into JSON-safe dicts and lists (schema
`reconix.assessment/v1`). It is built field by field, never with `asdict()` on the whole
assessment, so nothing is included by accident: the vault (`Secret`s, the login identity)
and HIGH-risk confirmation tokens are left out, and one-time codes are never stored
anywhere to begin with. Findings are the revealed ones; their evidence is already masked.

Every string is passed through `redact()` on the way out, so credentials an operator typed
(`https://user:pass@…`, a pasted cookie) or a tool printed never reach the saved file.

A decided gate can linger in `run.waiting_gate` until the next step plays; the snapshot
only reports the run as waiting while the decision is really missing, so a saved copy
never shows an approval that was already given as pending.
