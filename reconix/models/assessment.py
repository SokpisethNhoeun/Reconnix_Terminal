"""The assessment aggregate: one assessment and everything it owns.

The in-memory store keeps a list of these (one per assessment in the session) and a
pointer to the current one. Every per-assessment collection lives here, so assessments
are isolated and a past one can be reopened unchanged. Session-wide trails (audit
events, prompt history, feedback) stay in `store.lists`, not here.
